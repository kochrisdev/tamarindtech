🌱 Track 1: Foundations of AI Development
Duration: 2 weeks
Goal: Understand the tools, architecture, and core concepts behind AI-native development.

📦 Overview
Before diving into projects, you need to be familiar with:

What AI-native development is

How agent workflows operate

How to use your tools effectively: Replit, n8n, ElevenLabs, Lovable, and Supabase

This track is tool-oriented + concept-oriented, and everything you build here will serve as the building blocks for the rest of the program.

🧩 Week 1: AI-Native Development & Agentic Workflows
🔍 Key Concepts
What is an AI-native app?

What are Agentic Workflows? (Autonomous systems that observe, reason, and act)

Difference between automation and autonomy

LLMs as the new backend logic

📚 Learning Activities
Watch: What is an AI Agent?

Read: n8n Workflow Basics

🛠️ Hands-On Tutorial
Build Your First Agent Workflow

Tool: n8n Cloud or Local (https://n8n.io/)

Goal: Create a workflow that:

Accepts a user question (via webhook)

Sends it to OpenAI

Returns a response via email or chat

Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Webhook ➝ OpenAI GPT ➝ Gmail or Telegram
💻 Week 2: Stack Onboarding & Micro Projects
🛠️ Tools Setup
✅ Replit: Sign up

✅ n8n: Create a cloud instance or run locally

✅ Supabase: Free account

✅ ElevenLabs: Voice API Access

✅ Lovable: Set up account (for front-end app development)

📚 Learning Activities
Watch: Replit Full-stack Basics

Read: Supabase Quickstart

🧪 Mini Projects (Build to Learn)
🧱 Project 1: Hello World AI Workflow
Goal: Build a simple OpenAI-powered chatbot using n8n

Webhook triggers the workflow

User inputs a question

GPT responds

Response is logged or emailed

🎙️ Project 2: Voice Echo Bot
Goal: Use ElevenLabs to generate a voice message

Input: Text prompt via Replit

Process: Send text to ElevenLabs API

Output: Play back audio in browser or send a downloadable file

📊 Project 3: Data Logger
Goal: Connect Replit + Supabase

Use Supabase as a backend

Insert data into a table (e.g., questions + GPT responses)

Display all rows on a Replit-hosted front-end

# 🌱 Track 1: Foundations of AI Development

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Understand the tools, architecture, and core concepts behind AI-native development.

---

## 📦 Overview

Before diving into projects, you need to be familiar with:

- What AI-native development is  
- How agent workflows operate  
- How to use your tools effectively: **Replit**, **n8n**, **ElevenLabs**, **Lovable**, and **Supabase**

This track is **tool-oriented + concept-oriented**, and everything you build here will serve as the building blocks for the rest of the program.

## 🧩 Week 1: AI-Native Development & Agentic Workflows

### 🔍 Key Concepts
- What is an AI-native app?
- What are Agentic Workflows? (Autonomous systems that observe, reason, and act)
- Difference between automation and autonomy
- LLMs as the new backend logic

### 📚 Learning Activities

### 🛠️ Hands-On Tutorial  
**Build Your First Agent Workflow**

**Tool:** [n8n Cloud or Local](https://n8n.io/)  
**Goal:** Create a workflow that:
- Accepts a user question (via webhook)
- Sends it to OpenAI
- Returns a response via email or chat

**Example Workflow:**
Webhook ➝ OpenAI GPT ➝ Gmail or Telegram

## 🧪 Mini Projects (Build to Learn)

### 🧱 Project 1: Hello World AI Workflow
**Goal:** Build a simple OpenAI-powered chatbot using n8n
- Webhook triggers the workflow
- User inputs a question
- GPT responds
- Response is logged or emailed

### 🎙️ Project 2: Voice Echo Bot
**Goal:** Use ElevenLabs to generate a voice message
- **Input:** Text prompt via Replit
- **Process:** Send text to ElevenLabs API
- **Output:** Playback audio in browser or send as downloadable file

### 📊 Project 3: Data Logger
**Goal:** Connect Replit + Supabase
- Use Supabase as a backend
- Insert data into a table (e.g., questions + GPT responses)
- Display all rows on a Replit-hosted front-end
